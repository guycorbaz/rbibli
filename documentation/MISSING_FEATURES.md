## 📝 Development Approach: Native-First, WASM Later

### Current Configuration: Native/Desktop (Intentional)

**Development Strategy**:
- Start with native desktop development for faster iteration and easier debugging
- Slint supports easy cross-compilation to WASM later
- Same `.slint` UI files work for both native and WASM targets

**WASM compilation will be added later** when core features are implemented.

#### WASM Setup (To be added later):
- [ ] Add WASM dependencies (`wasm-bindgen`, `web-sys`, `wasm-bindgen-futures`)
- [ ] Create `index.html` for web deployment
- [ ] Configure WASM build target
- [ ] Update main.rs for WASM entry point (alongside native)
- [ ] Add HTTP client for WASM (`gloo-net` or `reqwest` with WASM features)
- [ ] Web server configuration for serving WASM

**Note**: This is a planned feature, not a blocker. Native development continues normally.
